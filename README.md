# Dotfile

## Installing

You will need `git` and GNU `stow`

Clone into your `$HOME` directory or `~`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmanhng/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles
```

Run `install.sh` to symlink everything or just select what you want

```bash
./install.sh # Everything
```

```bash
./install.sh zsh # Just my zsh config
```
